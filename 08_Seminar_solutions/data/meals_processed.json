You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid\r\neasily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step.\r\nUse natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife.

If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\r\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\r\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n \r\n2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\r\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\r\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\r\n\r\n3 Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.\r\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.\r\n \r\n4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\r\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.\r\nCover the pot, place the pot in the 300\u00b0F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\r\n \r\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\r\n6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\r\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\r\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\r\n8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the \"grain\" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.\r\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy.

Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.", "MealThumb": "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg", "Tags": "Snack,Treat", "Youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w", "Ingredient1": "Butter", "Ingredient2": "Plain Flour", "Ingredient3": "Lemon", "Ingredient4": "Butter", "Ingredient5": "Currants", "Ingredient6": "Mixed Peel", "Ingredient7": "Muscovado Sugar", "Ingredient8": "Cinnamon", "Ingredient9": "Ginger", "Ingredient10": "Allspice", "Ingredient11": "Lemon", "Ingredient12": "Eggs", "Ingredient13": "Sugar", "Ingredient14": "", "Ingredient15": "", "Ingredient16": "", "Ingredient17": "", "Ingredient18": "", "Ingredient19": "", "Ingredient20": "", "Measure1": "250g", "Measure2": "350g", "Measure3": "Juice of 1/2", "Measure4": "25g", "Measure5": "200g", "Measure6": "50g", "Measure7": "100g ", "Measure8": "1 tsp ", "Measure9": "1 tsp ", "Measure10": "1 tsp ", "Measure11": "Zest of 1", "Measure12": "1 beaten", "Measure13": "spinkling", "Measure14": "", "Measure15": "", "Measure16": "", "Measure17": "", "Measure18": "", "Measure19": "", "Measure20": "", "Source": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/786659/eccles-cakes", "ImageSource": null, "CreativeCommonsConfirmed": null, "Modified": null}, {"Meal": "English Breakfast", "DrinkAlternate": null, "Category": "Breakfast", "Area": "British", "Instructions": "Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\nCook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\r\nFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\r\nFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.", "MealThumb": "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/utxryw1511721587.jpg", "Tags": "Breakfast", "Youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjYU2Ensck", "Ingredient1": "Sausages", "Ingredient2": "Bacon", "Ingredient3": "Mushrooms", "Ingredient4": "Tomatoes", "Ingredient5": "Black Pudding", "Ingredient6": "Eggs", "Ingredient7": "Bread", "Ingredient8": "", "Ingredient9": "", "Ingredient10": "", "Ingredient11": "", "Ingredient12": "", "Ingredient13": "", "Ingredient14": "", "Ingredient15": "", "Ingredient16": "", "Ingredient17": "", "Ingredient18": "", "Ingredient19": "", "Ingredient20": "", "Measure1": "2", "Measure2": "3", "Measure3": "2", "Measure4": "2", "Measure5": "1 Slice", "Measure6": "2", "Measure7": "1 Slice", "Measure8": "", "Measure9": "", "Measure10": "", "Measure11": "", "Measure12": "", "Measure13": "", "Measure14": "", "Measure15": "", "Measure16": "", "Measure17": "", "Measure18": "", "Measure19": "", "Measure20": "", "Source": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/stressfreefullenglis_67721", "ImageSource": null, "CreativeCommonsConfirmed": null, "Modified": null}, {"Meal": "Escovitch Fish", "DrinkAlternate": null, "Category": "Seafood", "Area": "Jamaican", "Instructions": "Rinse fish; rub with lemon or lime, seasoned with salt and pepper or use your favorite seasoning.
