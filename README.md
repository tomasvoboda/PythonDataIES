# DataCamp access

If you have intention to do the course, request [Data Camp access here](https://forms.gle/Wj8kVFNBUfSG9vSK7)
check your spam folder for invititation email. There are still people who did not sign up, although invited.

# Project consultations
Everyone should have an **assigned supervisor**, who sent you feedback on your project. If not, let jan.sila@fsv.cuni.cz know ASAP.
Unless arranged otherwise with supervisor, sign up for consultations through [this link.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5qZgJMQRALaEeDQh5jeoa4HFA9x8Fd_vIsD95Uglqg/edit?usp=sharing)

# Midterm
Results are in SIS and solution was presented. If you have not received mark and should, please notify jan.sila@fsv.cuni.cz to sort it out.


# Project proposal
The only way to submit your project is through [project submission form](https://forms.gle/ptEqaNyL4Ar73SVZ7) so that we keep communication clear. You will get a consultant who will help you make the project better (or at least mark it for you). If you have tech troubles with the form, contact Jan.

## Communication
Please direct all questions at [Jan Šíla](mailto:jan.sila@fsv.cuni.cz) only.

Before you do, read the FAQ below!!
# FAQ - pre semester
* If you are on **waiting list** there is *nothing* we can do to enroll you. We managed to master somehow `python`, but SIS is something else. We follow the rules. Students usully drop from the course during the first week of the semester so **there is a good chance** you will be able to register.

* The course is held **in-person** and there is by default **no online** option.

* **Datacamp** is available to all who are enrolled. If you drop the course, let JS know to vacate the slot.

* If you are junior to last BSc year/ MSc level, please consider your coding skills. If you just started coding (R or anything else), please consider signing up later on. We will still be here (hopefully) next semester as well.
* If you decide to *drop out after the 2-week grace period*, note that if you start DataCamp homework, you will be awarded "F" mark followin the university guidelines. Please, do consider this as well with regards to staying in the course. There might be others waiting for the spot.

 # Prerequisities

 The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

 No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

 # Credits
 Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.
